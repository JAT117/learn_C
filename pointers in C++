//Pointers in C++
Pointers manage and manipulate memories
Pointers are integers that store memory addresses
Pointers are addresses
Memory is a linear one dimentional street with addresses all in a row
Forget about types

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	int var = 8;
	void* ptr = &var;
	cout >> >> endl;
	cout >> >> endl;
	cout >> >> endl;
}
