Task:applications organised into indepedent but cooperation programs. 

Task's Context
a) A thread of executions which is the tasks program counter
b) CPU registers and floating point registers
c) A stack for dynamic variables and function Calls
d) I/O assignments for standard input output and error
e) A delay timer, time slice timer, Kernel constrol structures

Task State Transition:
	Pended  Ready   Delayed
		   Suspended

Wind Task Scheduling:
	Preemptive Priority Scheduling
	Round-Robin Scheduling
	Premption Locks
		taskLock()
		taskUnlock()
		
Task Control
	Task creation and activation
	Task Stack
	Task Names and IDs
	Task Options
	Task Information
	Task Deletion and Deletion Safty
		``memory allocated during deletion is not freed when task is terminated.

InterTask Communications:
	Shared Memory: For Simple sharing of memory
	
	#include <iostream>
	

	Semaphores: Basic mutual exclusion and synchronization

	Message Queues and Pipes: For inter-tast message passing

	Sockets and Remote Procedure Calls
